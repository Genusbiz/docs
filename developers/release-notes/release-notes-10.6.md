**#23348 Fixed bug in item spacing for repeating container** (Web)

Prior to 10.6, a bug caused Item Spacing for the Repeating Container-control to resolve "Auto" to 0 pixels, in contrast to the standard behaviour that resolves "Auto" to 8 pixels.
This has been corrected in 10.6, causing all Repeating Containers with Item Spacing "Auto" to have spacing larger than maybe first intended.
When upgrading to version 10.6, check all Pages where Repeating Container is in use and change the setting "Item Spacing" from "Auto" to "None" to retain an item spacing of 0 pixels.
