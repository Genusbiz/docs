# Release notes for version 2019.2

## Introduction

This document lists all user-visible changes to Genus Apps since the previous release.

This release note will be updated prior to the release and may also be updated as long as the release is available, e.g. with information of new patches or known issues.

<!--rntype05-start BREAKING. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES BELOW WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->
<!--ID 3287e06b-fefb-4bb7-bbcd-446b10470cad -->

**#23210 Analyse - Change in required permissions** (Desktop;Web)

Modified permissions required to list analyses on web. In order for an analysis to show on web, we now require both FindAndList & ReadAndExecute.

<!--ID a75731f5-c5a7-4029-b0af-7ba954890f9f -->

**#23230 Line charts with a single category may lose some values** (Desktop)

Prior to this release, only the Lines chart had the possibility to group values by "Values" vs "Values not split by Category".
It was possible to add values to the "Values" group even when no "Split by Category" was defined.
This was not supposed to be the case, so after this release, only the "Values not split by Category" group is available when only a single category is defined.
For Line charts with a single category, all values not defined in the "Values not split by Category" group will therefore now be gone.

<!--ID 4300aaaa-bbbe-446e-a499-89d0c00870fa -->

**#23250 Analysis: Show Column Total rows for Formula columns is once again based on the defined Formula** (Desktop)

Show Column Total rows based on a Formula column no longer "overrides" defaults to a raw sum of all values in the column. Instead, the Total row calculated the Formula value based on the total of all Formula values.

For simple formulas, these two numbers would be the same, but this is not always the case for more advanced formulas.

<!--ID 271fe8e2-ca3c-4fae-a454-8e98cadc8def -->

**#23251 Analysis: Add option to override Column total with sum for Formula columns** (Desktop)

When showing Column total in Formula columns, the aggregate value no longer default to a raw sum. Instead, the Formula is executed with the sum of all values used in the Formula.

We have now introduced a flag for these columns, to override this behaviour with "raw summing". When the flag is raised, the Formula values are treated as raw values and summed to create the aggregate row value.

<!--rntype05-end   BREAKING. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES ABOVE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->

**#23220 Support for LDAP signing, sealing, and encryption (from version 18.45.75)** (Desktop;Services)

Back in August 2019 Microsoft released Security Advisory ADV190023 stating that a future Windows Update would change the default LDAP security policies. This would require an update from 3rd party software vendors to adjust to the new security requirements. After several revisions on this security advisory, Microsoft finally announced that

> _"The March 10, 2020 updates, and updates in the foreseeable future, will not change LDAP signing or LDAP channel binding default policies or their registry equivalent on new or existing Active Directory domain controllers."_

Please refer to these articles for details:

- https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/ADV190023
- https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4520412/2020-ldap-channel-binding-and-ldap-signing-requirements-for-windows
- https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/ldap-channel-binding-and-ldap-signing-requirements-march-2020/ba-p/921536

In response to the original security advisory Genus has introduced new security settings to strengthen LDAP security. Even though Microsoft no longer will enforce new LDAP signing or channel binding by default, we strongly suggest applying the following appSettings configuration options introduced by this Genus release:

- **DirectoryContext:LdapAuthenticationType**: Allows the administrator to specify what authenticaion security flags that should be applied by Genus when acting as an LDAP client. The value is specified on the form "_Flag1_ | _Flag2_ | _..._ | _FlagN_", where each flag is one of the values in the .NET Framework enum type [**System.DirectoryServices.AuthenticationTypes**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.authenticationtypes) and the bar character ("|") performs a _bitwise or_ operation between these values. Please note that the **Encryption** (or **SecureSocketsLayer**, which is simply an alias for Encryption) is not possible to combine with **Signing** and **Sealing**. If you do not specify any flags Genus will default to "Secure | ReadonlyServer". The following examples are recommended alternatives that should be added to the `appSettings` section of `appSettingsOverrides.config`, located at `%ProgramFiles%\Genus\Server\wwwroot`:

  ```
  <add key="DirectoryContext:LdapAuthenticationType" value="Secure|ReadonlyServer|Encryption" />
  ```

  or

  ```
  <add key="DirectoryContext:LdapAuthenticationType" value="Secure|ReadonlyServer|Signing|Sealing" />
  ```

- **AuthenticationService:LdapEnforceLookup**: By default the Genus authentication service will try to avoid performing unnecessary LDAP queries during the authentication process. You may override this behavior by specifying

  ```
  <add key="AuthenticationService:LdapEnforceLookup" value="true" />
  ```

<!--ID b3a4412f-5087-42ea-b181-115eae4dc828 -->

**#23229 Prevent more than one value being grouped by Split by Category** (Desktop)

Can no longer define more than one value to be grouped by Split by Category in Analysis Designer. This introduces the concept of "Values not split by Category" for some tiles (i.e. all Column & Line types). In such existing tiles with two categories, all but one Value will now only be grouped by the primary Category.

<!--ID 914fe07c-46b6-49ae-92ce-24a1a0af38d1 -->

**#23232 Multiple datasets in separate databases in Azure are supported** (Desktop)

However, there is still a problem with keeping data in separate databases in Azure. This is related to the location of the account table. Search in audit trail is therefore limited in multi-database Azure solutions.

<!--ID d7627870-5968-41c6-ba80-6fa744ed46b1 -->

**#23247 Added support for reading and writing JSON arrays containing simple values**

Earlier versions of Genus supported reading and writing JSON arrays containing objects which would be used for reading and creating objects in data sources.

Now it is also possible to read and write simple values, for instance strings. When reading a string from JSON, a new object will be created where the string is stored into the mapped field, while when writing JSON, data vill be read from the mapped field for each of the objects in the data source.

<!--ID 69b5686b-0f13-4a76-a791-60ed9053971c -->

**#23281 Responses with SOAP headers annotated with attribute mustUnderstand="1" caused an exception** (Services)

When consuming a SOAP webservice one or more SOAP headers may be returned from the service. If the web service retunred one or more SOAP headers annotated with a mustUnderstand="1" attribute the Consume a Web Service effect would throw an exception and the consuming action would simply fail. This behavior has now been corrected. Please note that the consuming action must assume the responsibility of understanding SOAP headers with mustUnderstand="1".

**#23259 Object Classes with Permissions = None can not be opened from Dasboard selections** (Desktop)

If the ID field of an Object Class has "Maximum permissions that can be granted" set to "None", it will not be possible to open Forms/Tables based on Dashboard selections on that OC. The Dashboard client will not be able to read the IDs of the objects, and consequently cannot open the objects.

This seems to be the case for multiple OCs in older Genus solutions. Business Engineers adding Dashboards to existing solutions should therefore be aware of this peculiarity.
