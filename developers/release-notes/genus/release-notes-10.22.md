<!--ID 46382d97-a0b7-145e-911d-42d9809dd8b5 -->

**#23617 Discontinued support for async execution of effects within a scope**

Async execution was limited to effects of type _Read Objects_ and _Consume a Web Service_, and was originally implemented to improve performance in the Politiagent app on Genus Mobile (solved in Genus 10 using a combination of message queues and live update).

The reason for discontinuing the functionality is based on that it not works as intended in all situations, and should be solved using other patterns and constructions.
