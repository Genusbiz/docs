**#23623 All instances of Genus for an application model must run in the same namespace in Kubernetes**

From version 10.22, every instance of the Genus runtime for a given application model must run in the same namespace. This is a **breaking change** from how it works before 10.22, where each instance ran in its own namespace; usually one each for origin, green and blue, as well as one for Genus Operator.  

Upgrading to this version will require a few minutes of downtime, and will require users to log in again.

This change will not impact performance or resource usage.

To upgrade to this version, a new namespace must be created using the genus-bootstrap image version 3.0.0 or later. Talk to Cloud Services for support with upgrading. This new namespace will replace the existing namespaces.
