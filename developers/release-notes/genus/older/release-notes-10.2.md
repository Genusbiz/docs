**#23274 Added GX language features** (Desktop;Services;Studio)

A few new string functions have been introduced:

* **String.split(chunkSize)** -- Splits a string into chunks of a fixed size. Returns a sequence of strings. Depending on the current string length and the specified chunk size, the last string returned may be smaller than the specified chunk size.
* **String.characters()** -- Splits a string into a sequence of characters. This is the same as calling String.split(1).
* **String.characterValue()** -- Returns an integer representing the Unicode value of a character. Throws an exception if the specified string does not contain exactly one character.

A new iterator operation has been introduced:

* **collection.collect( *elem* | an expression using *elem* )** -- Iterates the collection and returns a sequence where each element has been transformed. The expression acts as a transform to be applied to each element.

A collection of type Sequence or OrderedSet returns a Sequence. A collection of type Set or Bag returns a Bag.

**#23281 Responses with SOAP headers annotated with attribute mustUnderstand="1" caused an exception** (Services)

When consuming a SOAP webservice one or more SOAP headers may be returned from the service. If the web service retunred one or more SOAP headers annotated with a mustUnderstand="1" attribute the Consume a Web Service effect would throw an exception and the consuming action would simply fail. This behavior has now been corrected. Please note that the consuming action must assume the responsibility of understanding SOAP headers with mustUnderstand="1".
