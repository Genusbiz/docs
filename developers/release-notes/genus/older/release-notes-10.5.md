<!--ID 23cb93cf-2a7b-4739-b8e4-76d1c0f998ee -->

**#23324 Changes to helm values**

Several new helm values are added in Genus 10.5:

**global.modelIdentifier**

This value replaces _global.modelName_, which is no longer used.

**global.dnsSuffix**

This value replaces _global.subDomain_, but should now contain the entire dnsSuffix (everything except the first part of the host name). This allows for more flexibility when creating host names.

I.E: If your namespace is runs at _namespace.cluster.example.com_, **global.dnsSuffix** should now be "cluster.example.com", whereas the old value _global.subDomain_ would have been only "example.com"

**global.namespaceName**
The name of the namespace in which the chart are deployed. This is mainly used for validation purposes when deploying.

<!--ID ed8d27eb-863d-4bf7-b616-42f0586e3cf9 -->

**#23325 Changes in object links** (Desktop)

Moving from 19.X to 10.X links will normally change because of the introduction of cloud, and modifications to how dataset is represented in links. Links to objects and concepts will therefore normally no longer work.
Moving from 10.4 to 10.5 links will no longer contain their query parameters as an encrypted string, but as a human readable list of name value pairs. Links to objects and concepts made with versions <= 10.4 will therefore no longer work.

<!--ID c7b050f6-1136-4fde-9490-694fcb7d3af9 -->

**#23342 Operator relies on Endpoints to configure namespace routing** (Services)

Operator 4.0.0 relies on Endpoints to configure namespace routing. Endpoints can be assigned to namespaces in Studio. This requires Genus >= 10.5.

<!--rntype05-end   BREAKING. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES ABOVE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->

## Major new functionality

<!--rntype06-start MAJOR. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES BELOW WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->
<!--ID 20f60592-0649-4b7f-8294-252c195028f5 -->

**#23341 Operator allows routing to multiple active namespaces** (Services)

Operator 4.0.0 supports routing to multiple active namespaces. This requires Genus >= 10.5.

<!--rntype06-end   MAJOR. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES ABOVE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->

<!--ID a8aacef6-35f1-45a9-ab01-719b181139a9 -->

**#23343 Redis Sentinel** (Services)

Genus now supports the use of sentinels when deploying Redis. In the case that number of replicas for Redis is greater than 2 the pods will contain an extra container with Redis Sentinel. This container will form a cluster of Redis Sentinel nodes, which will promote a new master in case the actual one fails.

<!--ID f1196ae4-7f20-4574-8508-7390eed1f12f -->

**#23347 New client action effect supporting sending mail messages: "Send a Mail Message"** (Web)

The content of the mail message, such as addressees, subject, body, and attachments, are defined using a data set based on a data source of type _Mail Message_. Typically you would fill out the content using a _Create a Object_ effect or populate the data set from a dropped or selected msg-file. The effect creates an upload session so that attachments can be streamed to the server one by one in order to support large attachments.

<!--ID f9f24298-b2d8-443a-a548-b3b532a11b44 -->

**#23351 Tables in HTMLEditor** (Web)
