# Release notes for version 2018.1

## Introduction

This document lists all user-visible changes to Genus Apps since the previous release.

This release note will be updated prior to the release and may also be updated as long as the release is available, e.g. with information of new patches or known issues. Please take note of the [installation and upgrading](#installation-and-upgrading) comments, and the release notes [change log](#change-log).

## Installation and upgrading

Prior to upgrading to this release, you must:

- Upgrade to the previous release. See the Release notes for the previous release for more information.
- Review the Expiry date of your Genus License File and install a new one if necessary.
- Review the rest of the release notes for this release. Pay special attention to any issues in the sections [End-of-life functionality] (#end-of-life-functionality), [Deprecated Functionality](#deprecated-functionality), [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes) and [Known Issues](#known-issues). You may have to perform manual tasks.
- Please note that there does not exist any Genus Upgrade Assistant for this upgrade.

For general information about installing and upgrading Genus Apps, see [here](../../../installation-and-configuration/index.md). We especially recommend reviewing the [System Requirements](../../../installation-and-configuration/system-requirements.md) article.

## Important issues in this release

> [!NOTE]
> This section address the most critical issues and information for this release. These issues may require you to take corrective action either before or immediately after installation.

- **Link table in data mart no longer available.** Data marts that contains link tables must be manually converted to using selection filtering on connections in release 2017.5. It is not possible to edit or load data marts containing link tables in release 2018.1.

- **Don't leave faulty data mart load plans running on auto!** Each time it fails, it logs up to 1 MB. But since it may try to load every 2 minutes, it may amount to large volumes of data over time. See the article [Data mart problem solving and FAQ](../../../../users/analyze-report-and-discover/data-marts/data-mart-problemsolving-faq.md) for more information.

## End-of-life functionality

End-of-life functionality is functionality that was available in the previous release, but is no longer available in this release.

<!--rntype03-start END-OF-LIFE. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES BELOW WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->
<!--ID 97dcb628-3db3-44ea-b25e-d7232ec68943 -->

**#23004 Removing on Lost Focus from ComboBox** (Web)

Removing on Lost Focus from Combobox, as it does not consistently across browsers, and in most cases, it is more correct to use on Value Changed.

<!--ID 4df127ce-f00a-4f45-9053-229c928f7192 -->

**#23040 Views in Analysis is deprecated** (Desktop)

In versions up to 2017.4 Views was a concept in an Analysis.
The functionality is still present in 2017.5, but it is not possible to add new Views to an Analysis.

All the functionality in Views is available by other means.
To migrate an analysis with Views, do the following:

1. Save one copy of the analysis for each view, say A1 and A2 for an analysis with two views.
2. In analysis A1, check all Actions which has a Command of Type Switch View. All of these must be converted to Open Analysis with Same Selection and point to A2. Do the same in analysis A2.
3. In analysis A1, remove view A2. In A2, remove A1.

<!--ID 083b5f1c-142d-471d-af22-7e6906d44eee -->

**#23060 XY- and pie chart control in forms** (Desktop)

Will be removed in next release. No plans for replacement of functionality.

<!--rntype04-end   DEPRECATED. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES ABOVE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->

## Breaking changes

This section lists important changes introduced in this release. You will need to use this list in order to understand the changes you might need to make to your application to support the new release.

<!--rntype05-start BREAKING. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES BELOW WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->
<!--ID c983fc7e-70ab-4206-9346-024282be871f -->

**#22998 Changed serialization to JSON for collection values** (Desktop;Services)

When serializing collection values to JSON, we would in earlier versjons serialize the values as a string containing all values of the collection separated with commas.
This has now been changed so that the values are serialized as an array with the values serialized in the correct data type.

<!--ID 72bb8b1d-40ec-4428-86f2-508474943531 -->

**#23022 Initial Catalog connection string property is automatically assigned if supported** (Services)

Unless the **Initial Catalog** connection string property is assigned explicitly when specifying [Data Link](https://docs.genus.no/developers/installation-and-configuration/configure-and-maintain-genus-server/genus-server-configuration/directory-properties.html#general) in the Genus Configuration tool, the Data Link **Database** property value will now be automatically used as Initial Catalog. The exception is Oracle databases (which does not support the Initial Catalog property).

<!--ID dbeaa5d2-9d04-42c3-8731-866e994d1f26 -->

**#23053 Symbols from image library is no longer loaded on Genus Services.** (Services)

Support for using symbols from the image library is no longer supported on Genus Services as the loading and caching mechanism for images is not supported on Windows Server. The usage of symbols on Genus Server is limited and should only affect symbols displayed in distribution of Reports in Agents. Genus Apps for desktop is not affected by this change.

<!--rntype05-end   BREAKING. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES ABOVE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->

## Major new functionality

<!--rntype06-start MAJOR. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES BELOW WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->
<!--ID 97261108-3334-4b86-a467-fe57da24b68b -->

**#23017 Added detail pane to tables** (Desktop)

When designing tables it's possible to add a detail pane. The detail pane can contain calculations and it can modify objects. Commands from the detail pane form can be added in the tables ribbon section.

<!--ID 6984adc8-d560-4c10-bebb-204d3a0f1c2c -->

**#23025 Requirements imposed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** (Studio)

Support for reading and deleting audit trails introduced. For more information, see the Genus Apps documentation:

- [Reading data into built-in data sources](https://docs.genus.no/developers/defining-an-app-model/logic/action-orchestration/actions/effects/read-objects.html#reading-data-into-built-in-data-sources)
- [Delete the event history for objects](https://docs.genus.no/developers/defining-an-app-model/logic/action-orchestration/actions/effects/delete-objects.html#delete-the-event-history-for-objects)

Read of audit trails was previously not supported. Deleting audit trails was supported, but the functionality has been extended with the following functionality:

- For object classes defined in your directory, it is possible to delete audit trails for a filtered set of objects.
- Delete audit trails irrespective of age.

<!--ID 1e83ec51-2905-4ba4-bef4-79d77e5847bf -->

**#23029 Access to selected text for controls in actions** (Desktop)

In some cases you might want to perform some logic based on the current selected text in a form control, such as executing a search or classify named entities in a text.

To do this, define a command targeting a task, and then attach the command to the _On Context Menu Item Click_ event in a control supporting text selection. When the task is invoked from the context menu, the selected text can be accessed from the built-in _Action Orchestrator_ data source within the task:

```
Action Orchestrator.Current Text Selection
```

Note that you cannot disable a command based on the value for the selected text. To determine what to do, define a decision block in the task.

Controls supporting text selection:

- E-Mail Address Edit
- File Preview (MS Word, MS Excel, PDF, text)
- HTML Edit
- Rich Edit
- Text
- Text Edit
- Text Popup Edit
- URL Edit

One application of the function is to return a HttpStatusCode as a result of processing a request to a REST service defined in Genus Apps.

<!--ID decfb1ea-01b1-4fbe-a14a-d15d44943e54 -->

<!--ID 61f84418-eef0-4ea7-9f7a-e2491a7d3bc7 -->

**#23038 The term "directory" replaced with "app model"** (Studio)

In general, a directory is a structured listing of information.

The terms _directory_ and _app model_ have been used interchangeably in Genus Apps, but from now on we distinguish between these two concepts.

The directory is now the structure of a Genus app model, as displayed in the left-side menu inside Genus Studio. An app model is data (about a model) stored in a database and accessible through this structure by using Genus Studio. For more information, see [https://docs.genus.no/terminology.html#app-model](https://docs.genus.no/terminology.html#app-model), [https://docs.genus.no/terminology.html#directory](https://docs.genus.no/terminology.html#directory).

**#23052 Removed diagram view of the data mart from the analysis designer** (Desktop)

In previous versions it was not possible to open a data mart if it was locked by an analysis. This restriction has been removed, and you can open the data mart in a separate window even if it is locked by an analysis (the data mart wil automatically be write protected). From an analysis you can open the attached data mart from the **Actions** window menu.

The same functionality has been implemented for an analysis which is locked by a data mart.

<!--ID 9fafe4df-fbdd-4d26-82d5-266df7d5c7a7 -->

**#23054 Analysis - Selection history** (Desktop)

In older versions of analysis we kept 15 steps in our selection history. When this limit was reached, the oldest entry would be deleted. This limitation is now removed. The creator of the analysis now needs to keep in mind that the history can grow unlimited, and should therefore be cleared (e.g. on switch analysis)

**#23008 Fixed problem with serialization of non-ASCII characters when exporting JSON** (Desktop;Services)

Characters outside ASCII range (32-127) has been exported uising a Unicode escape format (\uXXXX) but this caused problems reading the exported text.

**#23104 Isolation Level "Read Uncommitted" incorreectly ignored for database commands** (Services)

A side-effect of a code change introduced in Genus Services 2017.1 effectively disabled use of the isolation level "Read Uncommited" for all database commands.

A symptom of this issue has been experiences with database deadlock in high volume scenarios.

The issue has been corrected with the following Genus Services versions:

- 2018.2, file version 18.20.50.0 and later
- 2018.1, file version 18.10.164.0 and later

Oracle does not support Read Uncommitted and has hence not been affected by this issue.

The issue has been corrected with the following Genus versions:

- 2018.2, all available versions
- 2018.1, file version 18.10.175.0 and later
