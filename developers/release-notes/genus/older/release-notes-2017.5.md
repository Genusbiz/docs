**#22968 Change in REST serialization** (Desktop;Studio;Web)

From version 2017.5 of Genus Apps, REST serialization is changed for fields that are not assigned either to a field in a data source or by a constant value.

In order to maintain the previous functionality, assign null-values to all fields that should be serialized.

**#22976 Made changes to keyboard navigation - tabbing** (Web)

Added better support for keyboard navigation. It is now possible to tab to more controllers, including text, symbols and tab sheet tabs. Tab stop are now disabled for controllers where this makes sense, but this may lead to some cases where tab stop has to be turned on to achieve the wanted result. In some cases, i.e. group boxes with click actions, tab stop was inferred, but this now has to be enabled manually.

The serialization has now been changed so that the default font in the editor is included in the html-document to keep a consitent appearance when used outside Genus Apps.

**#23115 Datamarts is not compatible with solutions having multiple appmodels on an app server.** (Desktop;Services;Studio;Web)

Loading of datamarts in solutions where multiple appmodels are assigned to single app-servers may trigger random stability issues. Datamarts may stop and become unavailable when certain combinations of appmodel deploy and modifications to datamart occurs.

Multiple appmodels per appserver is not supported when using datamarts.
