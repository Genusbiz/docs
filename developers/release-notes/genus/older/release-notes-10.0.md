<!--rntype03-start END-OF-LIFE. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES BELOW WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->
<!--ID 08b820fb-6f60-45c7-b503-d6cae5d87b0f -->

<!--ID f5364f89-b91f-425a-8b0a-bc34a1023278 -->
**#23163 Discontinued support for data type "Timespan" and interpretation "Time"**

To detect data type "Timespan" run the following: select * from g_object_class_property where dtp_tp = 10

To detect interpretation "Time" run the following: select * from g_object_class_property where pdi_tp = 1032

<!--ID 1ba35ca6-652a-4d62-88d3-d825c0eecf01 -->
**#23166 Discontinued data type "Timespan" and interpretation "Time of Day"**

These were not in use and have thus been discontinued.

<!--ID 0b580224-2162-46c1-be4a-d254e50fd4e2 -->
**#23217 Genus Mobile discontinued**

Genus Mobile is no longer supported, and apps developed in previous releases will not run when upgrading to Genus 10 or later.

<!--ID f50af1ae-8ce6-438b-a932-80b8a6497cdc -->
**#23218 Search folders (generic objects) discontinued**

Search folders containing generic objects no longer supported. This type of folder provided the ability to save a search returning objects of type Genus Report.

<!--ID 1f5fbbe6-636c-45e5-af91-96c5d78a15ea -->
**#23226 Direct printout of merged document in "Merge Data to a Document" effect no longer supported.** (Desktop)

File conversion and merge operations has been moved to a microservice, and therefore the *Print Document* option providing the ability to print the merged document has been removed. You will receive a warning when executing an effect where this option is selected.

<!--ID 243586ea-2331-4fac-9790-878e263ecc1b -->

<!--rntype04-start DEPRECATED. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES BELOW WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->
There is no deprecated functionality in this release.
<!--rntype04-end   DEPRECATED. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES ABOVE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->
## Breaking changes

This section lists important changes introduced in this release. You will need to use this list in order to understand the changes you might need to make to your application to support the new release.
<!--rntype05-start BREAKING. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES BELOW WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->
<!--ID 8734ab15-90c6-4a24-a3ce-e4b3f56633d0 -->
**#23159 Support for Computer account type has been removed** (Services;Studio)

Genus 10 removes support for Computer accounts. Before upgrading to Genus 10, you have to do the following:

1. Verify if any clients authenticate using its Active Directory computer account. This may be the case when an external service consumes a REST or SOAP web service that is published by your model. Change this into using Genus Directory accounts instead.

2. Delete all computer accounts: Open Genus Studio, Directory, Security, Computers, select all entries and select Delete.

<!--ID 85a6cff5-d9ae-408e-b62e-39564c72e019 -->
**#23206 Data Mart Load Plans no longer belongs to a Node Group**

Nodes and Node Groups are no longer in use. They where used for load balancing and for binding a Load Plan to a single Data Set. The load balancing is now handled by the Kubernetes infrastructure. A Load Plan has a new field "Data Set" which should be used if the Load Plan is only valid in a single Data Set. If not specified, the Load Plan is used in all Data Sets. Load Plans and their Data Set binding, through a Node, needs to be inspected before upgrading to Genus 10, so that they can be corrected. If a Load Plan was member of a Node Group which contained Nodes for multiple Data Sets, but not all, multiple Load Plans needs to be created, one for each of the Data Sets where it should be used.

<!--ID 3287e06b-fefb-4bb7-bbcd-446b10470cad -->
**#23210 Analyse - Change in required permissions** (Desktop;Web)

Modified permissions required to list analyses on web. In order for an analysis to show on web, we now require both FindAndList & ReadAndExecute.

<!--ID 4300aaaa-bbbe-446e-a499-89d0c00870fa -->
**#23250 Analysis: Show Column Total rows for Formula columns is once again based on the defined Formula** (Desktop)

Show Column Total rows based on a Formula column no longer "overrides" defaults to a raw sum of all values in the column. Instead, the Total row calculated the Formula value based on the total of all Formula values.

For simple formulas, these two numbers would be the same, but this is not always the case for more advanced formulas.

<!--ID 271fe8e2-ca3c-4fae-a454-8e98cadc8def -->
**#23251 Analysis: Add option to override Column total with sum for Formula columns** (Desktop)

When showing Column total in Formula columns, the aggregate value no longer default to a raw sum. Instead, the Formula is executed with the sum of all values used in the Formula.

We have now introduced a flag for these columns, to override this behaviour with "raw summing". When the flag is raised, the Formula values are treated as raw values and summed to create the aggregate row value.

<!--ID e6dd10ed-4c51-46c4-8f7f-1a615f5325b5 -->
**#23264 Permissions required to execute rest api methods** (Services)

Pre Genus 10 permissions where granted at the rest api level. In Genus 10, permissions are granted for each rest api method. Existing rest-api's will not be callable until permissions are granted.

<!--ID ed8d27eb-863d-4bf7-b616-42f0586e3cf9 -->
**#23325 Changes in object links** (Desktop)

Moving from 19.X to 10.X links will normally change because of the introduction of cloud, and modifications to how dataset is represented in links. Links to objects and concepts will therefore normally no longer work.
Moving from 10.4 to 10.5 links will no longer contain their query parameters as an encrypted string, but as a human readable list of name value pairs. Links to objects and concepts made with versions <= 10.4 will therefore no longer work.

<!--rntype05-end   BREAKING. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES ABOVE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->
## Major new functionality
<!--rntype06-start MAJOR. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES BELOW WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->
<!--ID 16fedd5d-f8dd-4918-82b7-29350a13cb1a -->
**#23260 Changes in terminology for main concepts (Oak)** (Studio)

The following concepts have been renamed

* Analysis -> Dashboard
* Report -> Analysis
* Task -> Action
* Web Service -> SOAP Service

<!--rntype06-end   MAJOR. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES ABOVE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->
## Minor new functionality
<!--rntype07-start MINOR. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES BELOW WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->
<!--ID 5fe955c0-ffba-4949-b49a-125ed6b18a85 -->
**#23146 Upper and lower bounds on numeric fields** (Studio)

Upper and lower bounds can be specified as constants on numeric fields.

<!--ID 8e45d0a2-04da-42d1-84a2-876ef9f0fc29 -->
**#23147 Checking App Model and Database consistency** (Studio)

Genus Studio has a action 'Check App Model and Database consistency'. This functions reads database information for tables and columns and compare it with the App Model and vice versa. The end result is written to a markdown file and opend in the assosiated application. The function is also available on a single object class.

<!--ID e41e873e-3268-4d62-a094-93d5f8257e52 -->
**#23149 Improved the support mail subject** (Desktop)

The support mail subject has been improved by describing all attachments and refering to GDPR when sending sensitive information.

<!--ID c0b579ad-c646-4d11-8af0-434f64a57654 -->
**#23150 External Interface on the datasource** (Studio)

All datasources will now have an External Interface section describing how data kan be moved to and from a Task/Form when it's used in an effect or a command.

<!--ID 8bc8ea13-e641-4bfa-bf01-7114170c3a6e -->
**#23173 Better handling of "The data mart has new data"** (Desktop)

When the data mart has new data, we load the new data and try to keep the current selection. A snackbar message notifies the user that "The Data Mart has been reloaded with new data".

<!--ID 4d726cf4-90cc-41c4-aa97-35f171ddf3ad -->
**#23216 Analyses - Reorder Values on Tiles with multiple Value Groups** (Web)

It is now possible to change the order of Values for all Tiles in the Analysis designer. Earlier, this was not possible for Tiles with multiple Value Groups (e.g. Line and Sankey charts).

It is also possible to drag Values between differen Value Groups.

<!--ID b3a4412f-5087-42ea-b181-115eae4dc828 -->
**#23229 Prevent more than one value being grouped by Split by Category** (Desktop)

Can no longer define more than one value to be grouped by Split by Category in Analysis Designer. This introduces the concept of "Values not split by Category" for some tiles (i.e. all Column & Line types). In such existing tiles with two categories, all but one Value will now only be grouped by the primary Category.

<!--ID 914fe07c-46b6-49ae-92ce-24a1a0af38d1 -->
**#23232 Multiple datasets in separate databases in Azure are supported** (Desktop)

However, there is still a problem with keeping data in separate databases in Azure. This is related to the location of the account table. Search in audit trail is therefore limited in multi-database Azure solutions.

<!--ID d7627870-5968-41c6-ba80-6fa744ed46b1 -->
**#23247 Added support for reading and writing JSON arrays containing simple values**

Earlier versions of Genus supported reading and writing JSON arrays containing objects which would be used for reading and creating objects in data sources.

Now it is also possible to read and write simple values, for instance strings. When reading a string from JSON, a new object will be created where the string is stored into the mapped field, while when writing JSON, data vill be read from the mapped field for each of the objects in the data source.

<!--ID 37e4bb68-01ea-464e-b6ff-b0f1beae0186 -->
**#23262 Sorting of Row Columns in 3D Grid disabled** (Web)

Sorting is now only enabled for "Column Category" of Three Dimensional Grid. It is no longer enabled for "Row Category" and "Row Data".

<!--rntype09-start KNOWN ISSUES. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES BELOW WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->
<!--ID 96c33bd6-09c9-4beb-9780-62bd007bab74 -->
**#23259 Object Classes with Permissions = None can not be opened from Dasboard selections** (Desktop)

If the ID field of an Object Class has "Maximum permissions that can be granted" set to "None", it will not be possible to open Forms/Tables based on Dashboard selections on that OC. The Dashboard client will not be able to read the IDs of the objects, and consequently cannot open the objects.

This seems to be the case for multiple OCs in older Genus solutions. Business Engineers adding Dashboards to existing solutions should therefore be aware of this peculiarity.

<!--rntype09-end   KNOWN ISSUES. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES ABOVE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->
