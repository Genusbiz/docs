## Introduction

This document lists all user-visible changes to Genus Apps since the previous release.

This release note will be updated prior to the release and may also be updated as long as the release is available, e.g. with information of new patches or known issues. Please take note of the [installation and upgrading](#installation-and-upgrading) comments, and the release notes [change log](#change-log).

## Installation and upgrading

Prior to upgrading to this release, you must:

- Upgrade to the previous release. See the Release notes for the previous release for more information.
- Review the Expiry date of your Genus License File and install a new one if necessary.
- Review the rest of the release notes for this release. Pay special attention to any issues in the sections [Deprecated Functionality](#deprecated-functionality), [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes) and [Known Issues](#known-issues). You may have to perform manual tasks.
- Please note that there does not exist any Genus Upgrade Assistant for this upgrade.

**#22869 Enhanced security -- consequences for load-balanced scenarios** (Services)

Genus App Services 2017.2 introduces a new encryption key mechanism. The first time you upgrade an application server to Genus App Services 2017.2 a new, unique encryption key will be generated and stored in appSettingsOverrides.config. If this server is part of a load-balanced cluster of multiple application servers you will have to distribute the encryption settings ("DefaultCryptoServiceProvider:DecryptionKey" and "DefaultCryptoServiceProvider:ValidationKey") from the appSettingsOverrides.config file to the appSettingsOverrides.config file on the other application servers _before upgrading_ the other servers to Genus App Services 2017.2.

This procedure is a one-time operation only when upgrading from a pre-2017.2 version of Genus App Services.

<!--ID 1394384b-9dfb-4554-9154-19c9b64c3015 -->

**#22890 Genus App Platform 2017.2 Requires .NET Framework 4.6.2** (Desktop;Services;Studio)

Prior to upgrading to Genus App Platform 2017.2, please make sure that .NET Framework 4.6.2 is installed. The Genus Desktop installer and the Genus App Services installer check that the required .NET Framework has been installed before allowing upgrading to Genus App Platform 2017.2.

The appropriate redistributable installation may be downloaded from Microsoft, see https://bit.ly/netfx462

**#22882 Changed behaviour of collapsed groupboxes** (Desktop)

For group boxes that are defined with IsCollapsible turned on and Vertical Alignment set to stretch, the runtime behaviour is changed so that they will only required the height of the header. Until now, group boxes would occupy the same space regardless of whether they were collapsed or not. This change supports a more dynamic use of the available space in the forms.

<!--rntype06-start MAJOR. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES BELOW WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->
<!--ID aae596a2-6db8-417a-9d80-5e64747b4d50 -->

**#22870 Improved support for import and export of JSON data** (Services;Studio)

In the previous version of Genus, import and export of JSON data were dependent on the structure of the datasource used in the import/export operation. To provide better flexibility, we have redesigned this functionality by providing a mapping mechanism that allows for more flexible JSON handling. The mapping mechanism is based on a template that describes the structure of the JSON data, and bindings that specify how data is mapped towards the JSON data.

The new mapping mechanism is currently available in the REST Method editor for import of Request Body, in the Export Data effect when exporting to JSON, as well as in the Consume REST Service effect for both the Request Body and Response Handlers.

<!--ID 5c14fee5-f48d-42ef-9ab4-de50d27184d6 -->

**#22897 Summary of new features in Analysis** (Desktop;Studio;Web)

New option "Open an Analysis" from a Form or Table etc, keeping the context. This is the first step to incorporate Analysis as a step in a adaptable and user centric workflow.

New option "Show uncategorized values as" enables naming uncategorized values to include them in a category grouping.

New option "Show remaining values as" enables naming all remaining objects as a single entry in a chart when cutoff is in use.

More flexible grouping of aggregates, similar to the functionality in Reports. Each value can use individual paths to dimensions during aggregation, and the paths are no longer limited to the ones defined for selection filtering.

Layout validation feedback upon save is added in Designer. Errors are shown on tiles and views.

Added support for non-numeric values in Measure, Measure List, Value Chips and Text control types. The values are picked from the first and only selected object in the data source.

Cutoff support added to Table.

Actions can be invoked in context menu

Conditional colors in Measure, Measure List, Value Chips and Text control types.

New Action "Open analysis with same selection" opens an analysis using the same data mart and the current selection.

Better support for using images as background in a tile. Top-align, repeat, combination of image and color, etc.

Added sorting in dropdown control.

Added symbol picker in map point layer designer.

Added support for screen tip based on markdown with value merging in map.

Accumulative Time Balance calculation. Allows presentation of accumulated values over time, for example accumulated sales year to date.

Added font size and grid spacing options for entire analysis.

Added coloring support for map point series.

Added selection/qualified/excluded colors to themes.

Management support for operating Data Marts. For example, log of data mart loading with time consumption and row counts.

<!--rntype08-end   RESOLVED ISSUES. DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS. ANY CHANGES ABOVE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.-->

## Known issues

Known issues are errors or lack of functionality. Known issues may be solved in a future release based on customer demand.

All Desktop Forms must be designed in a way that prevents Table and Report Controls from being hosted in scrollable areas of the Form. In most cases this could be catered for by stretch-aligning the Table/Report controls (including all parent groups of the Table/Report) within the Form, but there may also be other cases where other areas of a Form may cause scrollbars to appear in a group which includes a Table/Report control. When a Form has the problem described here, it will appear as the Table/Report is rendered floating above other controls in the window so that for instance the ribbon, status bar or other page content may be obscured. This will be a time limited restriction, and will be removed in a later release, when the changes in our user interface technology are completed. Any Table controls violating the requirement will have an undetermined behavior.

<!--ID e7518c90-26f0-49c6-b313-8b5700e76f26 -->

**#22886 Can no longer select null for not null-properties after making another selection (Combobox)** (Web)

It is now impossible to select null in a drop down list for properties who cant be null, after making another selection. This prevents displaying invalid states to users.
