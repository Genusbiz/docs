**#23508 Translated code domain members may cause errors when evaluating formulas on the web client**

**IMPORTANT**

If you have translated code domain members in your application model, you may experience errors when a formula defined on an object class property, such as a default or value formula, is evaluated on the web client.

The error would look something like 

*Invalid expression: timesheet.state = TimesheetState.draft. Errors: draft is not a construct of TimesheetStateClass.*

If you experience this error, please upgrade to version 10.14 or 10.15. Before you publish the application model, make sure that you do a minor change to an arbitrary object class, such as enter a temporary description, apply changes, remove the description, and then save changes.
