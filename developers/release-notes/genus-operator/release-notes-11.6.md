**#23707 BREAKING CHANGE: Discontinuing support for Helm 2 charts. Switch to using Helm 3/oci charts.**

The Azure container registry containing our Helm charts and container images are dropping support for Helm 2 charts. Genus have supported Helm 3 since version 10.22, and we will stop publishing Helm 2 charts after version 10.5.

To switch over from deploying the old charts to the new charts, some changes must be done to the deploy pipelines or GitOps (Flux or ArgoCD) configuration.

If you are deploying with pipelines, make sure that the pipeline job run on version 2.6.5 or newer of the `genusbiz/genus-bootstrap` image.

If you are deploying with Flux or ArgoCD, make sure that the HelmRepository definition is of type: "oci", and that the url is "oci://genus.azurecr.io/genus/helm".

More information about the change can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-helm-repos).
