Audit Trail History can now be viewed in the web client. The viewer is available in context menus and the Action Bar alongside Auditing and Permissions actions (right aligned in the Action Bar).

The viewer resembles the Audit Trail History viewer in Genus Desktop. Improvements to existing functionality includes pagination of events, more granular search, and the possibility to download Audit Trail History events as a spreadsheet.
